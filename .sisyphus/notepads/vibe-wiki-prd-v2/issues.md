## Technical Gotchas

### [2026-01-17] Known Issues to Watch
- **Tailwind v4 Dark Mode**: Requires custom variant syntax (not class:dark)
- **Next.js 15 APIs**: params/searchParams are now async (must await)
- **React 19**: May need --legacy-peer-deps for some packages
- **RTL Layout**: Icons like ArrowLeft are visually flipped in RTL context
- **Mermaid Rendering**: Needs unique IDs per diagram to avoid conflicts

## Problems Encountered
(None yet - will document as we build)
